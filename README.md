# Span-based-model-for-relation-extraction
This is the implementation of a span-based-model jointly optimized on named entity recognition and relation extraction on ACE05 dataset.
For implementation details, see span_based_model.pdf

For demo, run run.sh. Note that because of copyright issues, ACE05 dataset cannot be included here.
